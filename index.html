        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p class="justified-text">
          Recent years have seen an unprecedented level of technological uptake and engagement by the mainstream. From deepfakes for memes to recommendation systems for 
          commerce, machine learning (ML) has become a regular fixture in society. This ongoing transition from purely academic confines to the general public is not 
          smooth as the public does not have the extensive expertise in data science required to fully exploit the capabilities of ML. As automated machine learning 
          (AutoML) systems continue to progress in both sophistication and performance, it becomes important to understand the 'how' and 'why' of human-computer 
          interaction (HCI) within these frameworks. This is necessary for optimal system design and leveraging advanced data-processing capabilities to support 
          decision-making involving humans. It is also key to identifying the opportunities and risks presented by ever-increasing levels of machine autonomy.
          <br>
          This tutorial provides an expansive perspective on what constitutes an automated/autonomous ML system and how humans interact with such systems. The authors 
          also focus on the following questions: (i) What does HCI currently look like for state-of-the-art AutoML algorithms? (ii) Do the expectations of HCI within 
          AutoML frameworks vary for different types of users and stakeholders? (iii) How can HCI be managed so that AutoML solutions acquire human trust and broad 
          acceptance? (iv) As AutoML systems become more autonomous and capable of learning from complex open-ended environments, will the fundamental nature of HCI 
          evolve? To consider these questions, the authors project existing literature in HCI into the space of AutoML and review topics such as user-interface design, 
          human-bias mitigation, and trust in artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, to rigorously gauge the future of HCI, they contemplate how AutoML may manifest 
          in effectively open-ended environments. Ultimately, this tutorial serves to identify key research directions aimed at better facilitating the roles and modes of 
          human interactions with both current and future AutoML systems.
